Teriyaki Chicken is a classic dish we love to make. You take tender chicken, grill or pan-sear it until it's just right, then coat it in a homemade teriyaki sauce. The sauce is simple—soy sauce, a bit of sugar, and mirin for sweetness. It gives the chicken a nice, shiny glaze and deep flavor. Serve it with some rice and veggies, and you’ve got a perfect meal that’s both delicious and comforting.</p>

Ah, teriyaki chicken is one of those dishes that brings comfort with every bite. It’s simple but packed with flavor. We start by choosing the best cuts of chicken—usually thighs, because they stay juicy and tender. Then, we sear it in a hot pan or on the grill to lock in the juices and give it a nice, golden-brown crust.</p>
